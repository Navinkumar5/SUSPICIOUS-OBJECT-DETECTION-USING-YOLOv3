# SUSPICIOUS-OBJECT-DETECTION-USING-YOLOv3

ABSTRACT:
Security surveillance is becoming highly crucial as the frequency of school shootings, armed robberies, and terrorist operations are increasing constantly. By catching these activities early on, there will be a lot less collateral harm, which will lower the number of offenses. This work introduces real-time weapon identification approach using surveillance systems based on computer-vision. For the purpose of finding the weapons and confusion objects in this study, different YOLO approaches are used. The study concentrates on Scaled-YOLOv3 and YOLOv3 to efficiently differentiate between confusion objects and real weaponry. With mean
average accuracy (mAP@0.50) of 86.19%, Precision of 79%, and F1-score of 77%, YOLOv3 performs moderately better than Scaled YOLOv3. YOLOv3 also shows superior confidence score in pictures as well as video footage.

REQUIREMENTS:
• PROCESSOR : INTEL PENTIUM or INTEL I3 or MORE
• RAM 1044 MB TO 4096 MB
• OPERATING SYSTEM WINDOWS 10 OR ABOVE
• TECHNOLOGY PYTHON 3.6
• IDE VIRTUAL STUDIO CODE 

PROPOSED METHODOLOGY:
To automate YoloV3 process first we need to built training model using huge number of images (all possible images which describes features of suspicious objects) And Convolutional Neural Network using python.
